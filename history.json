      "response": "Kolkata, being a major city in India, has a significant presence of IT companies. While I don't have the most up-to-date or exact number, I can give you an idea of the IT industry in Kolkata.\n\nAccording to various sources, including reports and industry associations:\n\n1. **NASSCOM** (National Association of Software and Services Companies) has listed Kolkata as one of the top 10 IT destinations in India.\n2. As of 2020, there were over **1,300 IT/ITeS companies** in Kolkata, employing around 150,000 professionals (source: Bengal IT/ITeS Association).\n3. A report by **CBRE** (Cushman & Wakefield) stated that Kolkata had a total IT/ITeS stock of around **25 million sq. ft.** as of 2020.\n\nSome of the top IT companies with a presence in Kolkata include:\n\n1. TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)\n2. Infosys\n3. Wipro\n4. Cognizant\n5. Accenture\n6. IBM India\n7. HCL Technologies\n8. Tech Mahindra\n9. Capgemini\n10.

Salt Lake Sector V (one of the largest IT hubs in India)\n2. New Town (with several IT/ITeS projects and parks)\n3. Rajarhat (with IT/ITeS parks and infrastructure)\n\nTo get a more accurate and updated count of IT companies in Kolkata, I recommend checking with industry associations, such as:\n\n1. Bengal IT/ITeS Association\n2. NASSCOM\n3. Kolkata IT/ITeS Association\n\nThese organizations may provide more detailed information on the IT industry in Kolkata, including the number of companies, employment, and growth trends.\n\nWould you like to know more about the IT industry in Kolkata or is there something specific you'd like to know?"
